## üõ¢Ô∏è MySQL Database Integration

- This tool connects directly to your Eudemons Online server's MySQL database.
- Specifically, it reads from and updates the `cq_newtaskconfig` table.
- You can view and edit the `beginscript` (trigger script) for any event or activity.
- If an event/task is missing from the database, the tool will automatically insert it for you when you save.
- **Make sure you have MySQL credentials with write access!**
